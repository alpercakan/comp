Build Instructions:

	1) cd into the directory comp_compiler/
	   (You are probably there now, since you are reading this)

	2) First run:
	   		$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
	   and then:
	   		$ make	

	3) The program will be created as "comp" in the directory comp_compiler/

Running:

	For detailed info, just run:
		$ ./comp --help

	NOTE: While running the program, handcrafted.asm must be in the same directory as the program

Testing:
	The test files and their expected output Assembly code are in tests/

	Since you need A86 assembler to assemble the output codes, there is no test automation.
	However, expeceted outputs of the output codes are given, too, for manual testing.
