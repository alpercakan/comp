Build Instructions:

  1) cd into the directory comp_compiler/
     (You are probably there now, since you are reading this)

  2) First run:
       $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
     and then:
       $ make	

  3) The program will be created as "comp" in the directory comp_compiler/bin

Running:
  For detailed info, just run:
    $ ./comp --help

  NOTE: While running the program, handcrafted.asm must be in the same directory as the program

Testing:
  The test files and their expected Assembly code output are in tests/

  Since you need A86 assembler to assemble the output codes, there is no test automation.
  However, expeceted outputs of the output codes are given, too, for manual testing. 

  (There is no "expected" output and code file for test cases which are supposed fail due to syntax error)
